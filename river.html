	The rain has stopped minutes ago but the wind keep blowing. Humidity found the chance to become a layer of thick fog.
	Down the road a lone lamp flickers, giving a glimpse of life to the entrance of a port once crowded and full of life.
	Passing under the big sign "Mississippi Express" someone can clearly see the docks. A river-boat over there standing
	by a few wooden crates, waiting to be shipped. Two things catch the eye, the lighted cigarette of a worker taking his
	break near the crates and the vivid light coming from the foremans' room.
